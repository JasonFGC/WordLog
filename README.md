# WordLog
Discord bot for keeping track of words said. 

Current functionality is limited, this is my first project working with discord. 
Adding this to multiple servers will not work currently.

Currently, these commands work:
!add WORD 
!commands
!trackedwords

The word tracking is also currently working, it will send a message whenever a word is said, alongside the author of the message that includes that word.
